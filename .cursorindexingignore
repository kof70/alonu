# Cursor Indexing Ignore File
# This file tells Cursor AI which files and directories to exclude from semantic indexing
# but still allow direct access when needed
# 
# Note: Items in .cursorignore are already completely excluded from analysis,
# so this file only contains additional items that should be excluded from indexing
# but might still need to be accessed directly
